      This project is developed for a reputed construction company in the city.
      This company built many apartments in this city and they have a plan to
      construct many other apartments in the city. Presently they maintain all
      records manually, to keep track of sales, receipts, instalments,
      maintenance etc., The company is constructing many apartments every year,
      now it is very difficult to manage all the data manually, also if some
      information is required urgently then to obtain this is very difficult. To
      solve this problem now they are looking for better alternative solution.
